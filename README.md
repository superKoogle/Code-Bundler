# Code-Bundler
 
In this project, we have developed a tool for packaging code from different files in one file.

The tool is in the configuration of a CLI - command line interface, and its use is in the form of running a command on the relevant project folder.

Running the command will create the file that contains all the desired code

## Libraries
The System.CommandLine library provides the functionality required for command-line applications.

The library is currently in an experimental version and there may be changes in the next versions.
